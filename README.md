- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Mark

I am working on Unity Projects using C# and Probuilder to build 3D models.  
I have previously worked on Playcanvas with Javascript and have been dabbling in various programming concepts over the years.
I am always learning as do all programmers, but want to find work which I can complete from home.
My Projects are trying to include relevant and new techniques to solve problems.
One element I am keen to do is tackle things that are uncomfortable and challenging, to prove to myself I have what it takes.
My ultimate goal is to finish a few projects the results of which can then be the building blocks of a larger 3D War Game.
